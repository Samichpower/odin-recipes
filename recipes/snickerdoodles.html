    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for <em>delicious</em> snickerdoodle cookies. These cookies come out soft and thick with no dough chilling required.</p>

    <p>The recipe is taken from <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/soft-thick-snickerdoodles-in-20-minutes/">this website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups (375g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons cream of tartar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (2 sticks or 230g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
      <li>1 and 1/3 cup (267g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1/3 cup (70g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line two large cookie sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats (always recommended for cookies). Set aside.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the topping:</strong> Combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon together in a small bowl.</li>
      <li><strong>Make the cookies:</strong> Whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a medium bowl.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and granulated sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract. Beat on medium-high speed until combined. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed. With the mixer running on low speed, slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients in 3 different parts. The dough will be thick.</li>
      <li>Roll cookie dough into balls, about 1.5 Tablespoons of cookie dough each. Roll the dough balls in cinnamon-sugar topping. Sprinkle extra cinnamon-sugar on top if desired. Arrange 3 inches apart on the baking sheets.</li>
      <li>Bake cookies for 10 minutes. The cookies will be very puffy and soft. When they are still very warm, lightly press down on them with the back of a spoon or fork to help flatten them out. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
      <li>Cookies remain soft & fresh for 7 days in an airtight container at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
