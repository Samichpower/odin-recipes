# odin-recipes

This is a recipe page. I will use and learn valuable skills involving HTML. I'll be adding images, linking to pages, making lists. I will also gain experience using Git and GitHub.

LONG TERM PROJECT IDEA:
I want to add a system for adding recipes directly from the website and having it be formatting automatically. In theory I think it should be doable, but realistically I don't know how possible it may be.

Also want to add a customizable "tag" system, to categorize food and drinks more specifically.
